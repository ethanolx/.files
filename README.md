My development environment configuration files

## Stability
The `main` branch of this repository contains stable configurations
for various applications and software.

The target is mainly Linux (Fedora/Manjaro), although some
configurations are cross-platform, like Neovim's.

## Structure
The file structure of this repository almost mirrors that of
a typical home directory, with the `.config` directory adhering
to the XDG Base Directory Specification.

## Usage
There are sample installation scripts located under the `.scripts`
directory. However, do note that these are largely untested.

An alternative would be to follow the scripts as references
instead, manually installing and copying the corresponding
configuration files for the desired applications.
